# **Analysis of the Provided Iterative Merge Sort Algorithm**

The given code is an iterative, in-place merge sort implementation that aims to sort an array without using additional space or recursion. Let's analyze the time and space complexity of this algorithm.

---

### **Time Complexity**

**Overall Time Complexity: O(n log n)**

#### **1. Outer Loop (`segmentSize` Doubling)**

- **Initialization**: `segmentSize` starts at 2.
- **Condition**: The while loop continues as long as `(segmentSize / 2) < array.length`.
- **Iterations**: Since `segmentSize` doubles each time (`segmentSize *= 2`), the number of times the outer loop runs is proportional to log₂n.

#### **2. Inner Loop (Processing Segments)**

- **Segment Processing**: For each `segmentSize`, the inner `for` loop iterates over the array in steps of `segmentSize`.
- **Number of Segments**: Approximately `n / segmentSize` segments are processed in each iteration.
- **Segment Length**: Each segment has a length up to `segmentSize`.

#### **3. Merge Step (`mergesort_inner` Function)**

- **Operation**: The `mergesort_inner` function merges two sorted halves of each segment in-place.
- **Loop Inside `mergesort_inner`**:
    - Runs `length - 1` times for each segment.
    - Performs constant-time operations (comparisons, swaps) in each iteration.
    - **Time per Segment**: O(`length`), where `length` ≤ `segmentSize`.

#### **4. Total Operations per Level**

- **Per Level**: At each `segmentSize`, the total number of operations across all segments is proportional to `n`.
- **Calculation**:
    - Number of segments × Time per segment ≈ (`n / segmentSize`) × `segmentSize` = `n`.

#### **5. Total Time Complexity**

- **Levels**: There are O(log n) levels due to the doubling of `segmentSize`.
- **Total Time**: O(log n) levels × O(n) operations per level = O(n log n).

### **Space Complexity**

**Overall Space Complexity: O(1)**

#### **1. Auxiliary Space**

- **In-Place Sorting**: Sorting and merging operations are performed directly on the input array.
- **No Extra Arrays**: Does not use additional arrays or data structures proportional to the input size.
- **Variables**: Uses a constant number of variables (e.g., `segmentSize`, `index`, `length`), consuming O(1) space.

#### **2. Elimination of Recursion**

- **No Recursion Stack**: Converts the recursive merge sort into an iterative version, eliminating the O(log n) recursion stack space.
- **Function Calls**: Calls to `mergesort_inner` are not recursive and do not increase the call stack depth.

#### **3. In-Place Merging**

- **Swap Operations**: Merging is done in-place using swap operations without temporary storage.
- **Constant Space per Merge**: Each call to `mergesort_inner` uses a constant amount of space.

---

### **Conclusion**

- **Time Complexity**: The algorithm runs in O(n log n) time, processing the array in O(n) time at each of the O(log n) levels created by doubling `segmentSize`.
- **Space Complexity**: Operates with O(1) extra space, achieving in-place sorting without the overhead of recursion or auxiliary arrays.

---

### **Final Answer:**

The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n log n) and a space complexity of O(1), achieving in-place sorting without recursion.
